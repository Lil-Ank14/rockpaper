## About

A clone of the popular web-based, game rock, papers, and scissors. This version is made using HTML and JavaScript for users to play on their device. There are 5 rounds in a game, where the user can attempt to defeat the computer. At the end of the game, there is an overview of who won and by how many points. For now, this game works in the console, which can be accessed via Developer Tools.

## Why I built this?

As someone who has been in the programming field for a while, it's time to expand my horizons and learn new languages! JavaScript and HTML are the most common languages in front-end web development, which is why I decided it was time to learn both. This project has helped build a foundation that I plan to leverage for my future projects with NodeJS and ReactJS.
